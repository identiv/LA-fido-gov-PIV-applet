 * Provides an application-specific OwnerPIN implementation.
 * <p>
 * This implementation internally uses an OwnerPIN for its implementation,
 * but it specifically permits the definition of a 'soft' retry limit, which
 * allows the application to define a retry limit which is <b>less</b> than
 * the initial hard limit imposed by the OwnerPIN instance.
 * <p>
 * The rationale for this is that JCRE 3.0.4 does not support updating the
 * try limit value. From a security perspective, storing the soft try limit
 * in a variable in this class means that this limit is less protected than
 * one stored in OwnerPIN. The exposure for this threat is only limited to the
 * hard retry limit value however.
